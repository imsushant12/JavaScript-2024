# Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage

* Task 1: Write a script to save a string value to `localStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
* Task 2: Write a script to save an object to `localStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.
* Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `localStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
* Task 4: Write a script to remove an item from `localStorage`. Log the `localStorage` content before and after removal.
* Task 5: Write a script to save a string value to `sessionStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
* Task 6: Write a script to save an object to `sessionStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.
* Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `sessionStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
* Task 8: Write a script to remove an item from `sessionStorage`. Log the `sessionStorage` content before and after removal.
* Task 9: Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
* Task 10: Write a function that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Verify that both storages are empty.
