# Day 21: LeetCode Easy

* Task 1: Solve the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode.
    * Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number, and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
    * Log the indices for a few test cases.
* Task 2: Solve the "Reverse Integer" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digits reversed.
  * Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers ending in zero.
  * Log the reversed integers for a few test cases.
* Task 3: Solve the "Palindrome Number" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes an integer and returns true if it is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
  * Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like negative numbers.
* Task 4: Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists and returns a new sorted list by merging them.
  * Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.
* Task 5: Solve the "Valid Parentheses" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, and determines if the input string is valid.
  * A string is valid if open brackets are closed in the correct order.
  * Log the result for a few test cases.
