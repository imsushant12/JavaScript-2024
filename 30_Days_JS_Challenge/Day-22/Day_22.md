# Day 22: LeetCode Medium

* Task 1: Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
  * Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.
* Task 2: Solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
  * Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.
* Task 3: Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the X-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.
  * Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.
* Task 4: Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
  * Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.
* Task 5: Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.
  * Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
  * Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
